              played<br> between Alphogo(Google's Artificial Intelligence software)Lee Se -dol(Current Go world champion),we look at the history of<br> Humans VS Machines,and the innovations that have led to this Incredible moment in life.</em></p>

             <p>for as long as humans have built things,we've wrestled with the implications of what we've built.In many cases, these philosophical and<br> ethical wrestlings have made for great drama- think Frankenstein,or 2001: A Space odyssey. Often the hypothetical scenarios we envision<br> come remarkably close to true, and the discoveries wehave made in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning make clear that a<br> "computer with a mind of its own"is going to take over the world not such a fantastic thing to imagine any longer.</p>

            <h1><b>The Triumph of Deep Blue</b></h1>
            <p>perhaps this is why we are so captivated by human vs machine competitions,because the idea of being overcome by that which we've<br> created speaks to something very deep with our collective conciousness. When IBM's Deep Blue faced off against Gary Kasparov<sup>1</sup>,the<br> event resulted in more than<a href="three billion impressions.html"> thee billion impressions</a> around the world, and when IBM's later creation Watson challenged the champions on<br> Jeopardy,millions were gkued to the proceedings.</p>

           <h1><b>Deep mind's AlphaGo</b></h1>

           <p>Taking place right now, there is an event that , while not likely to scale the same media heights,may in fact have far greater implications<br> when it comes to the future of "intelligent" machines.On Narch9,in seoul,South Korea,a computing system know as AlphaGo(built by<br> researches at DeepMind-a Google Artificial Intelligence lab)began <a href="a-five game match.html">a five-gane match</a> against Lee Se-dol,one of the very best players in<br> the world at the ancient game of Go.</p>

           <p>Why is this so significant?</p>

           <p>Here is how the DeepMind team explained it in their paper<a href="master.html"> Mastering the Game of Go with Deep Neutral Networks and Tree Search:</a></p>

           <p><em>The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence due to its enormous search space <br>and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves.</em></p>

           <p>Put another way, winning at Go is a kind of Holy Grail for those who strive to create machines that can "think" on their own, because <br>success at this uniquely complex game seems to require something more than just skill, knowledge,and experience.it requires intuition.<br>Feel.Syle.Characterics we associate with humans,not with machines.</p>
